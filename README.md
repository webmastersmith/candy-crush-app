## Game Code Improvements
1. Added useCallback and useMemo to functions used inside useEffect.
2. Minor changes to game logic.
3. Added if statement logic to state, stopping unnecessary UI renders.

## Challenges that helped me improve as a Developer
1. VS code linting helped me improve memoization techniques for non-primitives (functions, arrays, objects).
2. Effective use of if statements to avoid unnecessary expensive UI renders.
3. Using the HTML5 Drag Drop API and the logic to control UI renders.

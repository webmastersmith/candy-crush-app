## Game Code Improvements
* Added useCallback and useMemo to functions used inside useEffect.
* Minor changes to game logic.
* Added if statement logic to state, stopping unnecessary UI renders.
* Removed setInterval and rely completely on React state management.

## Challenges that helped me improve as a Developer
* VS code linting helped me improve memoization techniques for non-primitives (functions, arrays, objects).
* Effective use of if statements to avoid unnecessary expensive UI renders.
* Using the HTML5 Drag Drop API and the logic to control UI renders.
* Understanding React state and memory management by removing setInterval from game.
* Adding DragDropTouch.js to translate HTML5 DragDrop API for mobile browsers that don't support the API.
